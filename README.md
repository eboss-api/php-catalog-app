EBOSS PHP API Catalog application
=============================


Introduction
------------
This is a PHP API Catalog application for the [EBOSS REST API](https://github.com/eboss-api/api-docs). 
This allows suppliers to quickly publish their products from the EBOSS website on their own server.


Access
------
Please [contact EBOSS](http://www.eboss.co.nz/contact) if you are an EBOSS supplier and would like access to the API.

Once approved EBOSS will supply you with an api username, api key, and brand id number.
Please see config.php for the configuration variables.


Requirements
------------
PHP 5.2 (5.3 recommended)

PHP curl extension installed or fopen enabled for external URLS


Setup
-----

There are many ways of integrating the app into your site.

This is the easiest (and fastest)

1. [Download the zip files from github](https://github.com/eboss-api/php-catalog-app/archive/master.zip)
2. Extract the zip files.
3. Edit the "config.example.php" to add in the API username, key (password) and brand ID supplied to you by EBOSS.  Then rename the file to "config.php".
4. Upload the contents of the extracted folder to a folder you create on your server via FTP. We suggest creating a directory folder (eg "catalogue" so it can be found at "supplier.co.nz/catalogue") that's included in your navigation menu.
   
   You should be able to see and browse the catalogue on via the url http://supplier.co.nz/catalogue/

5. Put the following snippet on the page within your site, where you want the downloader to appear (please update the url):
   ``<script type="text/javascript" id="EbossCatalogue" src="http://supplier.co.nz/catalogue/embed.js"></script>``

6. This app is designed to look good out of the box, however if necessary, basic styles can be tweaked in the "layout > css" folder.

This should not take longer than 30 minutes to complete.

We advise checking with your client before doing any work that requires additional hours outside of the two hours we have told them as an estimate of implementation time.

If you require a more seamless integration, please get in touch!
